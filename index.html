	<h2> What is TFT? </h2>
	<p>Teamfight tactics is an 8-player auto battle royale, where the goal is to be the last player standing by having the strongest team. 
	   You will start the game with 100 HP and each round you will have to fight one opponent.

			<td> In Teamfight Tactics, you fight other players using characters called champions but you don't actually get to control them. 
				 These units will fight your opponent's units by themselves and whoever has no more units left will lose that fight. <br>
				 There is also a tier for each champions ranging from 1 to 5, where 1 is the weakest and 5 is the strongest. You can tell which champion is which tier by their background color. Grey means that they are tier 1,
				 green is tier 2, blue is tier 3, purple is tier 4 and gold/orange is tier 5.  
				 Each champion has something called a trait and an origin. The main idea behind traits and origins is that if you have multiple champions with either the same trait or origin, they will do something special.
				 For example, there is a trait called gunslinger where if you have multiple of them, they will gain more attack damage per auto attack.

			<th>Gold</th>

		<tr>
			<td> Gold is a big thing in TFT due to that this is what you will use to buy your champions and do other important things. Another big aspect in TFT is leveling. You start the game at level 1 and at this level you can 
			only have 1 unit on the board but for each level up you can place one more unit, which allows you to take advantage of the traits/origins to gain that special effect. The max level that you can reach is level 9 and for each level, 
			there is different chances of getting each tier of champions. For example, at level 9 you will have the highest chances of gettings the tier 5 champions but the lowest for tier 1 and at level 1 you cannot get anything other than tier 1 champions.
			There is also a refresh function that allows you to reroll the champions in your current shop that consists of 5 champions.
